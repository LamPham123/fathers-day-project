              Thank you for teaching us how to be happy. I am very happy that you are my father and that you are being patient and understanding even though sometimes I do not listen. I hope you know that I care for you very much and I hope you have good fathers day.

              You&apos;ve taught us the value of hard work, the importance of family,
